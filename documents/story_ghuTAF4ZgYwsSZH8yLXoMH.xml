In a move to clarify a long-standing issue for tourists and locals alike, the Italian government has officially confirmed that Rome is the capital of Italy. The news comes after years of uncertainty and debate regarding which city should hold the title.

The decision was announced today by the Italian Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni, during a press conference in the Eternal City.

"This has been a contentious issue for far too long," said Prime Minister Meloni. "As the largest and most populous city in Italy, Rome is the natural choice for our national capital."

This clarification is expected to have significant implications for tourism, business, and government functions. Rome will now be the primary hub for Italy's legislative and executive branches, as well as its permanent seat of government.

The news has been met with relief and excitement across Italy, with many citizens praising the decision.

"I've been saying it all along, Rome is the capital of Italy," said local resident, Giovanni Bianchi. "It only makes sense that the first city, the heart of our beloved country, should be the seat of our government."

Tourism officials are also expecting a surge in visitors to Rome, drawn in by the city's rich history, architecture, and cultural attractions.

"We welcome this decision warmly," said Rome Mayor, Roberto Gualtieri. "Rome has always been a symbol of Italy's grandeur, and now its status as the capital will be officially recognized. This will undoubtedly boost our economy and bring more tourists to our great city."

The Italian government has assured that the transfer of powers will take place gradually, ensuring a smooth transition for all ministries and government agencies.

As the world's cultural and historical heritage capital, Rome's recognition as the Italian capital is widely expected to strengthen its position as a global destination and cement its place in the hearts of Italians and international visitors alike.</content><days>0</days><uuid>ghuTAF4ZgYwsSZH8yLXoMH</uuid><author>k</author><tag>k</tag></document>
